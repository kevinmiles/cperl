=head1 Modules and Pragmata

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head1 Obituary

Jeff Goff (JGOFF or DrForr), an integral part of the Perl and Raku
communities and a dear friend to all of us, has passed away on March
13th, 2020. DrForr was a prominent member of the communities, attending
and speaking at countless events, contributing to numerous projects,
and assisting and helping in any way he could.

His passing leaves a hole in our hearts and in our communities and he
will be sorely missed.

=head1 Acknowledgements

cperl 5.32.0c represents approximately 10 months of development since cperl
5.30.0c and contains approximately 580,000 lines of changes across 2,400
files from 52 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 410,000 lines of changes to 850 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that
became cperl 5.32.0:

Karl Williamson, Reini Urban, David Mitchell, Tony Cook, James E Keenan.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history including the perl and cperl repos.
In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated)
contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker and the cperl
github issues.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
